# What the e-dash engineering team values
[日本語版](https://github.com/edash-product/edash-engineer-team-policy/blob/main/README.md)

## About this Document
**Verbalization of our team values.** We believe that it is important for an engineering organization to clearly define the things that the team values and its policies in order to develop high productivity and high-quality products. We will also use it as a guideline for hiring new members to prevent early resignation due to mismatch.
This document will be regularly updated, similar to agile development.

## Knowledge Sharing
We believe that actively sharing our experiences and expertise is important. This contributes to the individual and team's improvement. We encourage actively providing knowledge through lightning talks and daily communication on Slack. Teamwork is one of the company's values, and this item is an extension of that concept. Also, let's actively publish articles on technical blogs and speak at external events. This will also brand you as a "highly skilled engineering organization", and outputting will also lead to personal skill improvement.

## Psychological Distance
Engineers are humans too. We believe that having a shorter psychological distance between team members increases motivation for work and improves team productivity. However, this does not mean that we expect you to engage in personal friendships such as hanging out together in private (although it is fine if you want). Please do not unilaterally negate someone with different values from yours. It would be great if you could occasionally react with stamps to the casual conversations posted on Slack. Teamwork is one of the company's values, and this item is an extension of that concept.

Feel free to ask questions whenever you are uncertain. If you're hesitating because you think your question might be too basic, don't worry. As long as it's not personal, asking questions in a public setting is preferable. This way, the knowledge gained can be shared with the entire team, benefiting everyone. When you receive a question or know the answer, be sure to respond proactively. An environment where everyone can freely ask questions promotes skill improvement for all of us and fosters the development of our entire organization.

## Engineer Positions and Careers
Engineers have multiple roles such as front-end, back-end, infrastructure, etc. At e-dash, we allow individuals to take on multiple roles according to their aptitude and preferences. We do not deny the desire to develop both front-end and back-end, and there is no problem with choosing to specialize in front-end development. Diversity & inclusion is one of the company's values, and this item applies to the choice of an engineering career.

However, if you want to challenge yourself in a field that you have no experience in, we believe that you need to personally catch up to a certain extent. For example, if someone who has only developed in front-end wants to challenge themselves in Go language development, they need to learn the grammar of Go language and how to use major frameworks on their own.

## Importance of Documentation
It is very important to document in order to prevent personalization. Be sure to provide a README in the Git repository, and try to describe the technology used in the relevant repository, the directory structure, and the method of building and operating the application. Be sure to describe the method of constructing the local development environment in the README or the company's internal Wiki, and make sure that new engineers can start implementing immediately. It is also recommended that these documents be periodically reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure that they do not become outdated as technology evolves or the project changes.

## Agile Organization
We believe that the way the team operates and its rules should be periodically reviewed and improved, including this document. We will discuss and update team management, development styles, and methods of technology selection with the current members at that time. Agile is one of the company's values, and this item is an application of that concept to the management of the engineering organization.
